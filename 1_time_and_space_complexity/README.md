# Time and Space Complexity

## What is Big O ?

Big O is a way to categorize your algorithms time or memory requirements based
on input. It is not meant to be an exact measurement. It will not tell you how
many CPU cycles it takes, instead it is meant to generalize the growth of your
algorithm.<br>

This means that 'O' of 'n' - 'O(n)' defines the computational complexity of the algorithm.<br>
In this case of 'O(n)', it means that the algorithm will grow linearily based on input.<br>
<br>
Big O notation is used in order to make decisions about what data structures and
algorithms to use.<br>
Big O notation help us predict how an algorithm will perform which ultimately help
us create the best adapted programs to resolve the issues at hand.<br>

## Imortant Concept

As your input grows, how fast does computation of memory grow? 

### 1. Growth is with respect to the input
