# Data Structures and Algorithms in C

Here you will find some data structures and algorithms implemented in C.
These algorithms are mostly based on "The Last Algorithms Course You'll Need"
by <b>The Primeagen<b>.

The Course is available here: [The Last Algorithms Course You'll Need](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/)<br>
Please go an check it out.<br>
You will not regret it.<br>
It truly is one hell of a course.<br>
This course is by far the best I've come by and is 100% FREE!

## Why?

My goal is to understand Data Structures and Algorithms. I went through several
courses and books and still strugle to implement and most importantly feel
comfortable with these concepts.

As I am currently studying The C programming language, I decided to go through
this course and implement the code in C in order to:

• Improve and strengthen my understanding of Data structures and algorithms<br>
• Improve my understanding of the 42 School writing guidelines
