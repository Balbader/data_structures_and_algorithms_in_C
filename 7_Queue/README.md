# Queue

• A queue in C is basically a linear data structure to store and manipulate the data elements. It follows the order of First In First Out (FIFO).

• In queues, the first element entered into the array is the first element to be removed from the array.

• For example, let’s consider the scenario of a bus-ticket booking stall. Here, the fashion of a C programming queue is followed. The tickets are distributed on the first-come-first-serve basis i.e. the first one to enter is the first one to be served with the tickets.

• A queue is open at both ends. One end is provided for the insertion of data and the other end for the deletion of data.
