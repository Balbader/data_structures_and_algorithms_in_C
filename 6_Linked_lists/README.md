# Linked Lists

AKA: Node based datastructure

Like arrays, Linked List is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays,
linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location; the elements are
linked using pointers. They include a series of connected nodes.<br>
Here, each node stores the data and the address of the next node.
