# Linked Lists

AKA: Node based datastructure

• Like arrays, Linked List is a linear data structure.<br>
• Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location; the elements are
  linked using pointers.<br>
• They include a series of connected nodes.<br>
• Here, each node stores the data and the address of the next node.
